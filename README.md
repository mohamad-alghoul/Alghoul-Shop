## About The Project

This project is a React-Redux application with Firebase authentication. It uses Firebase for user authentication, and the application itself is built with multiple components, maintaining a well-structured codebase. Due to the unavailability of a suitable API, a local JSON file was created to simulate data storage. The state management is handled using React-Redux and Redux Toolkit, providing a scalable and efficient solution. Tailwind CSS is employed for styling, contributing to a responsive and visually appealing user interface





### Built With
REACT_VITE_FIREBASE 
Firebase Authentication: Integrated Firebase authentication for secure user sign-in and sign-up processes.

Component-Based Architecture: Utilized multiple components to structure the application, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

Local Data Storage: Due to the absence of a suitable API, implemented data storage using a local JSON file to simulate a backend.

React-Redux and Redux Toolkit: Employed React-Redux for efficient state management and utilized Redux Toolkit for simplified configuration and development.

Tailwind CSS Styling: Utilized Tailwind CSS to style the application, achieving a responsive and visually appealing design.
